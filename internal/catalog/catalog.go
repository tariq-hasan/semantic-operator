// Package catalog defines the two model-derivation extension points, used by
// `ossiectl derive` only (the runtime introspects through the engine client).
//
// A Source reads physical structure: which tables exist and what columns they
// have. Physical truth must come from something authoritative about the
// current schema, so implementations read the catalog the engine itself uses
// (glue) or the engine's own information_schema (infoschema).
//
// An Enricher reads business meaning for structure that already exists:
// descriptions, business vocabulary, and sensitivity classifications. Metadata
// platforms hold this but serve an ingested copy of the schema, so they
// decorate a scaffold rather than define it. Implementations: datahub.
