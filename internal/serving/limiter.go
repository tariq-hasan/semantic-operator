// the query returns is released too early: the result is still allocated while
// the response is serialized and written, and a slow client holds that memory
// for as long as it takes to read. The next request would take the freed slot
// and add its own result on top, so the bound would not bound anything.

// and can still allocate a full cached result per concurrent request.
