"""Versioned physical-data manifest for the local demo.

There is a single fixed profile: the small (~44k-row) dataset. The calendar,
the plan and feature catalogs, and the Northstar anchor (account 1001) are the
same as the reference dataset. Every generator invariant still holds exactly
(see the generators module).
