# Enrich the ingested Iceberg datasets with the semantic-operator
# metadata (structured properties, glossary, ownership, PII/confidential tags,
# certification/deprecation, lineage). Runs the enrichment engine client-side
# via uv (PEP 723 inline deps in enrich.py) against the GMS NodePort. Uses the
# local metadata (physical_table bound to the iceberg catalog) and the same
# platform/instance the ingestion emitted.
#
# Extra args pass through, e.g.:  make datahub-enrich ARGS=--dry-run
