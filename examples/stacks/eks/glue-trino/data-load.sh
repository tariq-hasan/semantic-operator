# Loads the retail demo tables into a Glue-backed Iceberg schema through Trino.
#
# Source is Trino's built-in tpcds connector, so nothing outside this cluster is
# read and no extra S3 grant is needed. Trino writes the Iceberg files to the
# warehouse its own catalog is configured with, and Glue tracks the metadata.
#
# Idempotent. IF NOT EXISTS skips tables that already exist.
